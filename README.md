# PSTL-GraphCompression:
PSTL-GraphCompression is a project we realized in our second semester of Master 1 STL - Sorbonne University. It's a C project for handeling and compressing very large graphs, inspired by https://www.ics.uci.edu/~djp3/classes/2008_01_01_INF141/Materials/p595-boldi.pdf.  

There are two version, the development version is in GraphCompression, the original one we did during the second semester of the MSc is in PSTL.  
PSTL : original version.  
GraphCompression : development version, it allows the use of different compression codes for the different sections of the lists of successors, and it's lighter code-wise, it contains only what's necessary to run the project.  
Read the "README.md" files inside the folders.
